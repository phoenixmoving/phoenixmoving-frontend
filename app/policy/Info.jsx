          is customer&apos;s responsibility to do a final “walk-through” at the
          pickup location to ensure the movers have taken everything that needs
          to be moved. Having the form of payment, you choose to use at the end
          of the job ready will save you time and money. Please note: Any
          payments with a personal check have to be granted by your moving
          coordinator.

          The final cost of your move will be determined by multiplying the
          actual number of hours our moving crew had worked by the hourly rate
          indicated on your estimate, travel time, the amount of packing
          materials used, the amount of valuation coverage and any will be added
          to the final cost of your move, additional services listed below (if

          Labor time starts upon the arrival of our crew at your location and
          ends upon the departure from your final destination. Labor time is
          calculated based on 15-minute increments at the rate indicated on the
          estimate. Any travel between the origin and the destination is
          considered to be part of the labor time.

          final destination back to our parking office. Those charges are
          prorated based on 15-minute increments and are calculated by the
          reading of the GPS or Google Maps. In case if our truck is being
          delayed by traffic, the additional time incurred will not be added to
          the bill.

          We do not move large upright pianos up or down flights of stairs

          Exterior stairs are fine, but we encourage sending us pictures of
          entrances at each location, so that we can confirm that we can move
          your piano. There may be circumstances when we cannot safely move
          items and will need to discuss the situation with you. If the piano
          has thin legs (usually the front), we will not be responsible if they
          will not go back on if we take them off (sometimes the nut is loose
          inside the piano and will turn when you try to replace the leg). If
          the customer elects to leave the legs on, we will not be responsible
          if damage occurs to them.

          to the weight of these items, damage may result to floor surfaces or
          walls so before we proceed with moving these items we will have a
          release of any liability signed so we can move those items for you.

          The size of the moving crew is determined by the number of items that
          will have to be packed and/or moved as well as factors like access on
          each moving location, walking distance, stairs, etc. We recommend a
          certain number of movers for each job taking in consideration all the
          above as well as our current schedule, availability, etc. On extreme
          situations, Phoenix Moving & Storage might recommend sending extra men
          and/or truck during the day to complete a job if there is an overflow
          of items that needs to be moved, or additional packing required, a
          time restriction, very difficult access or very difficult pieces of
          furniture, etc. The hourly rate will be increased accordingly and the
          move will run more efficiently with more movers.
